apply the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and ensure DRY code and best practices, I will refactor the convert_md_to_json.py script by breaking it into smaller, more focused classes and functions. I will also ensure that the code follows international standards.

Plan:

Create a new directory for the refactored files.
Refactor the MarkdownConverter class into smaller classes and functions.
Ensure DRY code by reusing common logic.
Follow best practices and international standards.
Steps:

Create a new directory markdown_converter.
Create separate files for different responsibilities:
markdown_converter.py: Main class to handle the conversion.
file_reader.py: Class to handle file reading.
json_writer.py: Class to handle JSON writing.
validator.py: Class to handle JSON validation.
Refactor the code into these files.
Implementation:

Create the markdown_converter directory.
Create and write the refactored code into the respective files.
